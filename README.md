2DP4 MICROPROCESSOR PROJECT: DATA ACQUISITION AND DISPLAY

Detail specification of project please check the 2017_2DP4ProjectSpec.pdf file.

* 10bit, 420Hz sampling frequency single channel analog signal acquisition system

 The main purpose of the precondition circuit is to amplify, DC offset add-in on input signal and overvoltage protection. The exact parameter is depends on application.

# ** Updated serial communication program**
* support real-time display waveform
* Fourier analysis enabled
